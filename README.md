# DevOps Assignment – Dockerfile + Basic Linux Commands

## 📌 1. Five DevOps Concepts

### **1. CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)**
Automatically building, testing, and deploying applications so that new changes reach production faster.

### **2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
Managing servers and infrastructure using code (Terraform, Ansible, etc.) instead of manual configuration.

### **3. Containerization**
Packaging applications and dependencies together in portable containers using Docker.

### **4. Version Control**
Using Git to track changes, collaborate, and maintain the project history.

### **5. Automation**
Reducing manual work by automating builds, tests, deployments, and system setups.

## 📌 2. How I Completed This Assignment

### **Step 1: Created Dockerfile**

I created a Dockerfile that uses Ubuntu, installs basic tools, and runs a script containing Linux commands.

### **Step 2: Created `commands.sh`**

Added basic Linux commands (pwd, ls, df, ps, tree).

### **Step 3: Built the Docker Image**

```sh
docker build -t my-linux-commands .
